## Contribution
This project is made for the course Scientific Programming at Maastricht University. Contributors to this project are welcome and options
for improvement can be found in the discussion section of `index.html`. Although, I (*Kris Evers*) would like to be kept up to date on all
ideas that are put forward by contributors before it is included in the master branch of the project. I expect contributors to follow 
the rules written in the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.
